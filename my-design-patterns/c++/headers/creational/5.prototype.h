// Prototype pattern refers to
//      creating duplicate object
//      while keeping performance in mind.

// This pattern involves implementing a prototype interface which tells to create a clone of the current object. This pattern is used when creation of object directly is costly. For example, an object is to be created after a costly database operation. We can cache the object, returns its clone on next request and update the database as and when needed thus reducing database calls.

namespace PROTOTYPE {
//	Abstract base class with a pure virtual clone() method.
//	A class that needs a "polymorphic constructor" capability
//		derives from above abstract base class, and
//      implements the clone() operation.

  // Abstract class
  public:
  virtual ~Prototype() {}         // virtual destructor
  virtual Prototype *clone() = 0; // Acts as a virtual copy constructor - clones itself - returns 'ConcretePrototypeX' as 'Prototype'
};
