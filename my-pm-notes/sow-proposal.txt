SOW
Scope of Work

	A Scope of Work (SOW) provides
		detailed information on a project,
		often from the client side, and
			may include things like
				project size,
				budget,
				schedule,
				background,
				involved parties/authorities having jurisdiction,
				review processes,
				and any other information the client deems pertinent to provide.

	Providing a SOW allows
		a client to receive
			more detailed and
			tailored proposals
				for the projects
				they’re requesting

Proposal

	A proposal is a marketing tool
		that responds
			to the requirements
				given in the SOW.

	A proposal may include
		a section on understanding the project,
		in which
			the proposer reiterates their interpretation of the SOW and
			explains how they might accomplish it

---------------------------------

SOW is a statement of work
	which can be part of
		a Request for Proposal (RFP) or
		even part of the proposal.

Proposal has much more then just
	a statement of work or
	even the technical approach.

	A proposal consists of several sections, including but not limited to:
		technical volume
		management volume
		cost volume
		representations and warranties
		exceptions
		resumes
		and past experience.

		A proposal also tends to have
			one or more win-themes and
			one or more themes
			which differentiate the offerer (the team, company, or individual submitting the proposal)
				from its competition.
		The proposal sells the potential customer on the idea that
			the offerer is the best choice and
			that the price is the best price
				(not always the lowest although that is the horrible trend in US Government contracting).
		The proposal is the
			ultimate sales and
			marketing and
			(light) engineering and
			(light) description of the best organization and people to do the work

---------------------------------

Proposal is an
	non-binding
	not-legal document
		which just consists of the
			bidder’s proposal
			in terms of
				solution
				indicative pricing
				experience and
				expertise, etc.

SOW is a
	legal document
	which gets
		signed
		once a bid has been awarded to a particular bidder
	It is the final document
		which gets
			signed by the winning party and
			the client and
				this forms the basis of
					further project ongoings.
---------------------------------
Proposals will have
	delivery methodology
	communication plan
	team composition
	team structure
	rasci chart
	deliverable artefacts
	case studies
	references
	SW/HW requirements
	project team details
	practice write ups
	SLA info etc.
		in extra away from the above artefacts
---------------------------------
SOW that would specify
	steps/actions/deliverables each party would be contributing
A proposal would contain perhaps
	a technical description
	legal terms and conditions
---------------------------------
Proposal
	would want to know
		the price
		the details of how to tackle the project

Invitation to negotiate (ITN)
	If a project were very complex, then an 
		invitation to negotiate (ITN)
			might also be issued

			Negotiations would take place
				after
					proposals were already made and
					a competitive range established.
---------------------------------
Request for proposals are
	most often
		qualitative in their focus
			in other words, they 
				focus on the
					types of services or
					the qualities of a product
						that is being delivered.
			Price is a factor but usually not the only factor.

With a bid request,
	price is usually
		the primary factor being considered
	This may be because
		the product or service
			involved in the procurement
			is fairly standard,
		or has been properly established in its dimensions
			through a prior request for information.
	With price being the primary focus of the bid request,
		the character of the deliverable
			for the potential client changes
				dramatically from a proposal.
---------------------------------
Which proposal situations is more likely to use the direct approach?

	when you're creating an executive summary for a solicited proposal

	The executive summary will provide a clear overview.
	if the proposal is requested, then the reader knows the situation so the writer can be direct.
---------------------------------

What is the most important dot" to connect?"

	each dot is an equally important part of producing a quality proposal
	Each step/dot of the report writing process needs to be followed and completed.
---------------------------------
Which of these answers is a thorough answer (rather than a general answer)?

	Demographics of the 200 survey respondents included income, gender, and age.
	Specifics include number of responders and which demographics were analyzed.
---------------------------------
Find the example of redundant wording that should be avoided.

	each and every one
	the best and most acceptable approach possible
	due to the fact that
		Each answer contains redundancy.
---------------------------------
When is the best time to use a chart for your proposal?
	Charts can be beneficial before, during, and after writing the proposal draft.
	Charts can be useful in planning, in reviewing progress, and in analyzing at the conclusion of the project.

---------------------------------
What is the one commonality that all proposals have?
	Each proposal has unique characteristics.
	No one exact standard exists for proposals.
---------------------------------
What is the main reason to read carefully the RFP?
	The proposal may be labeled non responsive if all the RFP requirements aren't met.
	A proposal may be rejected (be labeled non-responsive) if it doesn't meet the requirements.
---------------------------------
What's the best way to determine how much time to schedule for preparing a proposal?
	determine if writing the proposal is a collaborative effort
	consider how familiar the writer is with proposals
	make a chart
		Charting a timeline, familiarity, and staff available are all factors to help determine the time factor.
---------------------------------
What is an example of an external solicited proposal?
	a government agency that issues an open RFP
	Government is outside the company (external) and an rfp is a request ( solicited).
---------------------------------
What is an example of a solicited internal proposal?
	an email from the company owner asking a company team for a new marketing campaign
	Someone inside the company asked for the campaign.
---------------------------------
What is an example of an unsolicited internal proposal?
	an employee identifies a company problem and decides to make management aware of the problem and of a solution
	Both the writer and the reader work for the same company (internal) and management did not request the proposal (unsolicited).

PROPOSAL

	What determines which parts your proposal will need?
	whether the proposal is solicited/unsolicited and formal/informal
	Both whether the proposal is requested or unsolicited and the formality will determine which proposal parts to include.

---------------------------------
How many subsections should a proposal body include?
	five: time, costs, personnel, evaluation methods, and goals
	a many as the writer thinks is necessary, but the budget should be emphasized.
	as many as possible with overlap so key points are emphasized
	there is no exact number

How many subsections should a proposal body include?
	there is no exact number
	Although standards do exist, the number of subsections will vary proposal by proposal.
---------------------------------
What should be included in the appendices of your proposal?
	items that are supplemental and/or provide more specific detail
	Charts, timelines, diagrams--items that will give the reader more specifics/depth.
---------------------------------
After your proposal is submitted, how long should you wait before following up?
	the writer should follow up within 3-5 days, depending on the situation
	This is solicited but external.
